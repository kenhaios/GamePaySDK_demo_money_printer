\f0\fs24 \cf0 In the Money Factory Android idle clicker game, implement these critical improvements and bug fixes: 1. FIX COIN DISPLAY BUG: Fix the coin count display in MainActivity.kt that's not showing correctly. Ensure the coin TextView updates properly when coins are purchased or spent, and verify GameRepository correctly saves/loads coin balance. 2. CREATE COIN-TO-CASH EXCHANGE: Create CoinExchangeActivity.kt with conversion options: 1 Coin = 100 Cash, 10 Coins = 1,100 Cash (10% bonus), 50 Coins = 6,000 Cash (20% bonus), 100 Coins = 13,000 Cash (30% bonus). Include RecyclerView layout and add navigation button from MainActivity. 3. ADD PREMIUM COIN SHOP AS TAB: In MainActivity.kt, create a TabLayout with two tabs: "Automation Tools" and "Premium Tools". The Premium Tools tab should display special items purchasable with Coins: Super Printer (150 Coins) - 2x all automation permanently, Golden Touch (300 Coins) - 10x click value permanently, Time Accelerator (200 Coins) - 3x production for 2 hours, Money Magnet (400 Coins) - auto-collect 5% production per second, Mega Boost (500 Coins) - 10x all production for 30 minutes. Use ViewPager2 or fragment switching to handle both tabs in the same activity. Include PremiumItemManager.kt to handle permanent/temporary effects and integrate with GameEngine.kt. 4. SMOOTH MONEY ANIMATION: Update MainActivity.kt money display to animate smoothly over 0.3 seconds using ValueAnimator when automation items are purchased. Add green color flash when money increases and update display every 100ms during gameplay for excitement. 5. PRINT MONEY BUTTON EFFECTS: Enhance the PRINT MONEY button click with: sparkle/star particle effects around button, scale animation (1.1x then back to 1.0x), ripple effect from click point, floating money text moving up and fading out, brief screen shake. Use ValueAnimator for smooth rewarding animations. 6. NAVIGATION INTEGRATION: Add two shop navigation buttons in MainActivity.kt: Coin Shop and Coin Exchange (Premium Tools is now a tab in main screen). Add slide transition animations and ensure coin display refreshes when returning from shops. 7. PREMIUM SYSTEM BACKEND: Create complete premium items system with permanent multipliers, temporary boost countdown timers, proper saving/loading in GameRepository, UI indicators for active boosts, and full integration with GameEngine money calculations. 8. POLISH & UX: Add haptic feedback for purchases and clicks, sound effect placeholders, confirmation dialogs for expensive purchases (>1000 coins), loading states, success/error toasts, and proper number formatting (1.2K, 3.4M) throughout. Create all necessary activities, layouts, managers, and update existing files. Ensure everything works together as a cohesive, exciting idle clicker experience that will showcase payment SDK integration effectively.}
